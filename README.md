Data Augmentation:

Use data augmentation techniques such as bootstrapping to create additional synthetic data points based on the existing dataset.
Simplify Models:

Use simpler models that require fewer data points and have fewer parameters to estimate.
Regularization Techniques:

Apply regularization methods (like Lasso or Ridge regression) to prevent overfitting when dealing with limited data.
Cross-Validation:

Use cross-validation methods to make the most out of the small dataset and to estimate model performance more reliably.
Domain Knowledge:

Incorporate domain knowledge to guide the analysis and interpretation of the results. This can help in making informed assumptions and decisions.
Transfer Learning:

If applicable, use transfer learning from related datasets or pre-trained models to improve the performance of your analysis or predictive models.
Bayesian Methods:

Consider using Bayesian methods that can incorporate prior knowledge and provide more robust estimates with small sample sizes.
Data Imputation:

For handling missing data, use advanced imputation techniques like Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE).
Feature Selection:

Perform careful feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and focus on the most relevant variables.
Visualization:

Use visualization techniques to understand the data better and identify patterns or anomalies that might not be apparent from statistical analysis alone.
